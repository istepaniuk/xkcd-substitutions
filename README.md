Using just vanilla JavaScript, it will make your news reading a lot more fun!

 *  'witnesses' -> 'these dudes I know'
 *  'allegedgly' -> 'kinda probably'
 *  'new study' -> 'Tumblr post'
 *  'rebuild' -> 'avenge'
 *  'space' -> 'spaaace'
 *  'google glass' -> 'Virtual Boy'
 *  'smartphone' -> 'PokÃ©dex'
 *  'electric' -> 'atomic'
 *  'senator' -> 'elf-lord'
 *  'car' -> 'cat'
 *  'election' -> 'eating contest'
 *  'congressional leaders' -> 'river spirits'
 *  'homeland security' -> 'homestar runner'
 *  'could not be reached for comment' -> 'is guilty and everyone knows it'

Just add to your GreaseMonkey user scripts, stir, shake, `roflcopters`.

The script comes with `http://bbc.co.uk` as included site, adjust to your prefs!
